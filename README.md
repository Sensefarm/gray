# Gray
Development of Gray hardware and software

Gray is an outdoor box that contains and connects to agriculture and smart city sensors.
As my ambitions are a bit larger than my time and to promote innovation in this area, I'm publishing it on the internet as a trial with a MIT license.

## Version control
We use a version of git-flow to keep things nice, tidy and traceable to issues. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow 
1. Create a separate issue for everything you intend to do. ( assume it's issue 1, and it's about new files)
2. Create a branch from that issue ( call the branch 1-new-files. If using github website this will happen automatically.)
3. Checkout the branch locally, add the files, do a "git add *files*", do a "git commit -m '#1 added new files'", "git push"
4. Find the branch on github, and create a merge request. 
5. Merge the branch, delete the branch (so the github website does not end up listing too many old branches), close the issue (github will do most things for you).
